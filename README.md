# 🧠Mental-Health-Risk-Predictor

Mental well-being matters—now more than ever. This project dives into the world of data-driven mental health analysis by building a machine learning model that predicts an individual's mental health risk using lifestyle and emotional well-being factors. Whether you're a data science enthusiast, mental health researcher, or someone just curious, this repository offers an insightful, end-to-end ML pipeline.

💡 Project Objective
The goal is to create a predictive model that classifies individuals into mental health risk levels based on a variety of features including:
1. Age, Gender, Employment status
2. Work environment, stress levels
3. Sleep patterns, physical activity
4. Depression and anxiety scores
5. Social support and productivity

By analyzing these, we aim to uncover patterns and risk indicators that may not be visible to the naked eye.

🧰 Tech Stack
Python 3
Pandas, NumPy for data handling
Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization
Scikit-learn for ML modeling
LabelEncoder & StandardScaler for preprocessing
Random Forest

📊 Dataset
📦 Source: Kaggle - Mental Health Dataset
🔢 10,000 records with 14 features
🎯 Target variable: mental health risk

🔍 Workflow
1. Data Preprocessing
2. Cleaned, encoded, and scaled the dataset.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Work environment vs treatment seeking behavior
5. Model Building & Evaluation
6. Trained classifier: Random Forest
7. Evaluated using Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, and Classification Report

🧪 Results
📈 Accuracy: High across all models, with Random Forest outperforming.

🎯 Insight: Stress levels, sleep duration, and social support were strong predictors.
